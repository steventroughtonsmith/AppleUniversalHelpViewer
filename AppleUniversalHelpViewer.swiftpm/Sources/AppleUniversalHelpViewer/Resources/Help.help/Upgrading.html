		<h3>Upgrading</h3>
		
		<p>The free version of Broadcasts is full-featured, but it has a fixed limit on the number of stations you can save to your library. Unlocking your library allows you to take full advantage of features like <b>CarPlay</b>, <b>Apple Watch</b>, and <b>Apple TV</b>. You can also remove items from your library to free up slots for new stations, if you'd like to remain using Broadcasts for free.</p>
		<p>To remove this limitation, you can elect to <b>Upgrade</b>.</p>
		<p>You can upgrade Broadcasts from the Upgrade panel.</p>
		<span class="menudirections"><p>From the main menu, choose Broadcasts > Upgrade to Full Versionâ€¦</p></span>

		<h3>Universal Purchase & Family Sharing</h3>
		<p>Broadcasts supports <b>Universal Purchase</b> and <b>Family Sharing</b>. This means a single purchase will unlock Broadcasts across all your devices, and for anybody in your Family Sharing group.</p>
		<p>When unlocking Broadcasts on a new platform, or a new person's account, for the first time, choose the <b>Purchase</b> button in the Upgrade panel. This will verify your previous purchase with the App Store, and grant access to the existing license. You will not be charged a second time.</p>
		<p>For subsequent installs, you can use the <b>Restore Purchase</b> button instead.</p>
