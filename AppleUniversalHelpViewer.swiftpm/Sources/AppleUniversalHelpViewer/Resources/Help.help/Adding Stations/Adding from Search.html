		<p>You may preview any of the search results, and, if you wish, <b>Add</b> them to your library to sync to other devices, or to use them from <b>CarPlay</b> or <b>Apple Watch</b>.</p>
		
		<p>You can view details about the selected station, like tags, codec, and more, in the <b>Details</b> panel. You can also <b>Add</b> the station to any of the collections in your library.</p>
