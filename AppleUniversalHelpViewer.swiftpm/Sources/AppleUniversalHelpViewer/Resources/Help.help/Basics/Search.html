		<h3>Search</h3>
		<p>From the <b>Search</b> screen, accessed via the Search tab or by clicking the Search field in the sidebar, you can search from the global database of stations by <b>name</b> and/or by <b>tag</b>.</p>

		<p>The global database is cached periodically so it can be searched offline. It may be redownloaded manually to pick up the latest station changes, or will automatically be updated passively as you browse the <b>Station Browser</b>.</p>
