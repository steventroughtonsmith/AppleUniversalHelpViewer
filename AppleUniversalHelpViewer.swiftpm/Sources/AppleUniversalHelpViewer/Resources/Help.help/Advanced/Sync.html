		<h3>Sync</h3>
		<p>Broadcasts supports syncing your library between devices using <b>iCloud</b>. Sync is enabled by default, and should work out of the box. When sync is enabled, the iCloud version of your library is always treated as the primary source. Making any change to your library will push those changes to iCloud, and to all your devices.</p>
		<p>Sync can be disabled completely from the Settings panel. This will not remove a synced library from iCloud, and the next time sync is re-enabled the iCloud library will replace the local library.</p>
		<p>Some features of Broadcasts, like its <b>Apple Watch</b> and <b>Apple TV</b> companion apps, require sync to function.</p>

		<h3>Enabling Sync</h3>
		<p>iCloud sync requires <b>iCloud</b> to be enabled on your device, and any devices you wish to sync to using the same Apple ID. It also requires <b>iCloud Drive</b> to be enabled for Broadcasts on each device.</p>
		
		<p><b>Note:</b> Your device and iCloud storage must not be full, and your Apple ID password, security & payment settings must be up to date, or iCloud sync may be impaired. Sync may also be delayed if other apps with higher priority have an unfinished sync, like <b>Books</b> or <b>Photos</b>, if your device has been recently restored from a backup, or if your network restricts iCloud traffic.</p>
