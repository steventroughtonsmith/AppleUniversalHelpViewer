		<h3>Handoff</h3>
		<p>Handoff lets you quickly transfer your playback from one device to another, like from Apple Watch to Mac, or from iPhone to iPad.</p>

		<p>When you begin playback of a station in Broadcasts, it gives it to Handoff to let other devices in your vicinity, logged into the same Apple ID, know.</p>
		
		<hr/>
		<p>On macOS, a new icon for Broadcasts will appear at the end of the <b>Dock</b>, with a badge depicting the currently-playing device. Clicking this icon will open Broadcasts, and will begin playback on your Mac.</p>

		<p>On iPhone or iPad, Handoff is presented as a banner at the bottom of the <b>App Switcher</b>. Tapping this will transfer playback to Broadcasts.</p>
