		<h3>Sharing a Station or Collection</h3>
		<p>You can share a station, or a collection of stations, to another device via the Share Sheet.</p>
		<p>Right-click, control-click, or, on iOS, long-press, a station in your library, or a collection in the collections tab or sidebar, and choose <b>Share</b>.</p>
		<p>This will archive the selection, including its artwork, into a <b>.broadcasts</b> file. You can share this file with other devices, and when opened will prompt the receiver to add the shared stations or collection to their library.</p>
